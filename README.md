## Features

- üîÑ Generate random inspirational quotes

2. Click "Tweet" to share the current quote on Twitter
3. Click "Copy" to copy the quote and author to clipboard
4. Click "Speak" to have the browser read the quote aloud

```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser, or use a local development server.

## Usage

Simply open the application in a modern web browser. The app will automatically load a random quote on startup. Use the buttons to interact with the quote:

- **New Quote**: Fetches and displays a new random quote
- **Tweet**: Opens Twitter with the quote pre-populated in a new tweet
- **Copy**: Copies the current quote and author to your clipboard
- **Speak**: Uses your browser's text-to-speech capabilities to read the quote aloud
